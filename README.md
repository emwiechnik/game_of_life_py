# Game of Life
This first committed version was one of the implementations of Game Of Life developed - through pair programming - during a 45-minute session on the CodeRetreat Wroclaw on 18 November 2017

After that I added graphics handling, so that the game is displayed in a window on a board.

Feel free to clone!
